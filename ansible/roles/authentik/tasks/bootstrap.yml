      Bootstrap Configuration:
      ✓ Admin user 'akadmin' automatically created
      ✓ Password: (stored in secrets file)
      ✓ API token: (stored in secrets file)

      The admin account and API token are automatically configured
      via AUTHENTIK_BOOTSTRAP_* environment variables.

      Note: HTTPS access requires DNS propagation and SSL certificate
      issuance. This typically takes 1-5 minutes after deployment.
      Authentik is accessible internally and the deployment will continue.
